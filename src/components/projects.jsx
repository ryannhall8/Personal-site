        <p className="project-description">
        I built a responsive e-commerce site using React and styled it to create a clean, user-friendly interface. I integrated the Fake Store API to display real product data and added features like user authentication, a shopping cart, and a simple checkout flow. This project highlights my ability to work with APIs, manage state with React, and build a smooth front-end shopping experience.
